# User Interface Overview

Gaea’s interface is built around a simple loop: **build your terrain in the graph**, **preview it in the viewport**, and **refine it in the property editor**.

## Infinity Graph

At the center of Gaea is the **Infinity Graph** - a node-based workspace where you create terrain logic by placing nodes and connecting them into a flow. The graph is designed to scale from small experiments to large production graphs without forcing a rigid structure.

## Viewport

The **Viewport** is your primary preview area. It supports both 3D viewing (with an optional 2D viewport) so you can evaluate terrain shape, scale, and detail while you work.

The **Viewport Toolbar** provides quick controls for:

* **Preview resolution** (from 512 up to 4096)
* **Lighting and atmosphere** (sun/light/atmosphere controls)
* **Render styles** (for example realistic, clay, or data-visualization styles)
* **Viewport toggles and tools**, including showing/hiding the 2D viewport and measurement/picking tools

The viewport can be used **embedded** in the main layout or as a **floating window**. Navigation includes Orbit, Free/WASD, and Orthographic modes, along with controls for common viewport elements (grid/bounds/compass) and camera save/load.

## Property Editor

When you select a node, its settings appear in the **Properties panel (right side)**. Changes are applied immediately and reflected in the viewport, supporting rapid iteration.

Properties may include:

* Numeric values and sliders
* Toggles and dropdowns
* Color controls
* File pickers and related inputs

A **Property Editor Toolbar** provides node-focused actions such as replacing the selected node with a related one, managing state (revert/reset/save state), and enabling gizmos for nodes that support viewport manipulators.

## Modifiers

Gaea also supports a **Modifier Stack**, which lets you apply lightweight, post-process adjustments to a node’s output. Modifiers are intended for quick refinements without having to rebuild or restructure large parts of your graph.

## Data View

On the **right side of the Graph**, the **Data View** offers tabs for inspecting and navigating project information. The Terrain view includes a node tree organized by Tabs → Groups → Nodes, plus filters that help you locate specific nodes quickly (by type, export-marked, heavy nodes, error nodes, and more).

## Menus and Fast Access

Gaea’s **Main Menu** follows standard application organization (File, Edit, Graph, Node, Preview, Project, Tools, Help), providing access to project management, graph tools, baking/build/export actions, and diagnostics.

For faster navigation, the **Lazy Menu (F1)** provides a configurable, keyboard-first hub for jumping to key UI areas and tools (such as Graph, Viewport, Properties, Modifiers, Node Tree, Variables, and Build controls).

## Interface Map

The image below identifies the main regions of the Gaea interface. Use it as a quick reference while reading the rest of this page.
