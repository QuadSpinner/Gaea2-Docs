# Tiles

The **Tiles** tab controls how tiled builds are named and arranged on disk. Use it when exporting large terrains as multiple tiles for engines, DCCs, or large-world workflows.

## Tile Output Settings

* **Tile Suffix Pattern**: Choose a suffix format for naming tiles, for example `_y%Y%_x%X%`.
* **Add Leading Zeroes**: Adds leading zeroes to tile numbers for consistent filename length.
* **Start Numbering from 1**: Starts tile numbering from 1 instead of 0.
* **Organization**: Select how tiles are organized in the output, such as folders for each node.
* **Flip Y Axis**: Reverses the Y-axis orientation for tile output.
* **Preserve Cache in Build Folder**: Retains tile cache files in the build folder for later use.
* **Overlap Pixels**: Set the number of overlapping pixels between adjacent tiles for smoother seams.
