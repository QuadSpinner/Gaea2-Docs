# Managing Input and Output

It is crucial to be able to modify the Input and Output filenames for automating a workflow via @command-line-automation.

To do so, you need to bind the filename / path properties of Input and Output nodes to variables and modify the values through the Command Line or by@#using-files-for-variables.

## Input

The `Filename` property of the File node can be bound to a variable. Ensure `Relative Path` is not checked unless you are passing a path relative to the `Gaea.Swarm.exe` file. You should also disable Caching (which is off by default).

## Output

The `OutputPath` property of the Export node can be bound to a variable. However, the `Location` property is key to where the node will export your file.

* **Build Folder:** The Export node will save the file to the build folder specified in the [Build Destination](/ui/interface/build-options/build.html#build-destination-and-file-handling) options. The filename will be the name of the Export node. So if the Export node is renamed to `SouthErosion` and the format is set to PNG16 then it will be saved as `SouthErosion.png`.
* **Custom:** The Export node will save to the folder specified in the `OutputPath` property, but the filename will follow the same naming as above.
* **Explicit:** The Export node expects the `OutputPath` property/variable to provide a fully qualified path, NOT including the extension. The extension will be decided by the option selected in the Format Options grid in the node.
